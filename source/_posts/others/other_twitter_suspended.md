Hello，

I'm having similar trouble. Getting to "We are calling +86{我手机号} with a verification code. Enter that code below." The phone number is 100% working but no call ever comes. Been trying for days now.

Best Regards

Hello,

Your account is now unlocked, and we ’ re sorry for the inconvenience.

Twitter has automated systems that find and remove automated spam accounts and it looks like your account got caught up in one of these spam groups by mistake. This sometimes happens when an account exhibits automated behavior in violation of the Twitter Rules ( https://twitter.com/rules).

Again, we apologize for the inconvenience. Please do not respond to this email as replies will not be monitored.

Thanks,

Twitter Support
